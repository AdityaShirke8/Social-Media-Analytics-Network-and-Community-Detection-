# üì° Social-Media-Analytics-Network-and-Community-Detection-
Dynamic Social Network Evolution Visualizer: animate the step‚Äëby‚Äëstep growth of a social graph with NetworkX &amp; Matplotlib, and explore its communities and key influencers in an interactive Dash Cytoscape dashboard.

## üß† Overview

This project simulates the **evolution of a dynamic social network** using two powerful approaches:

1. **Matplotlib Animation** ‚Äî Animates the network's construction over time.
2. **Dash Cytoscape Dashboard** ‚Äî Offers an interactive, analytical view of the network as it evolves, with centrality metrics and community detection.

## üîç Features

### üéûÔ∏è NetworkX + Matplotlib Animation

* Progressive edge addition over time.
* Spring layout with consistent positioning.
* Clear visual of how network structure builds up.

### üß¨ Interactive Dash Web App

* Timeline slider to explore each stage of the network's growth.
* Louvain community detection (visualized with node colors).
* Centrality metrics (Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector).
* Hover tooltips for node details.
* Dynamic markdown displays:

  * Top 3 influential nodes by each metric.
  * Full centrality table for all nodes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Dash** & **Dash Cytoscape**
* **NetworkX**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Louvain Community Detection (`python-louvain`)**
* **Gunicorn** (for deployment readiness)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityashirke/social-network-evolution.git
cd social-network-evolution
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Dash App

```bash
python app1.py
```

Then visit: [http://127.0.0.1:8050](http://127.0.0.1:8050)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Animation (optional)

```bash
python animate_network.py
```

> A Matplotlib window will pop up showing the evolving network step-by-step.
